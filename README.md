# Deep Learning

Laboratories carried out with @vipermu and @diegovincent of the Deep Learning course in our last year of our Bachelor in Universitat Pompeu Fabra.  
Course name: Deep Learning.  
Language: Python.  
IDE: Google Colab.  
Objectives: Learn to use some of the latest Neural Network Architectures for their different applications with the corresponding Deep Learning techniques and PyTorch.

## Description
Laboratories:
  - Lab1: Basic Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
  - Lab2: Different CNN Architectures: HourGlass and ResNet.
  - Lab3: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long short-term memory Neural Networks (LSTM).
  - Lab4: Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
